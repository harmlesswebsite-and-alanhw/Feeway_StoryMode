This is the news report on FM 66.6 Radio, PeePee FM. 
Today's headlines: There is currently a crash north of the amusement park, so if you are driving there, you should be 
careful. The logging ride also officially opened in the
amusement park, so you should go there if you want to 
experience it. At the zoo, a monke (should I say monkey?) has
escaped the zoo. It has been going into the restrooms and drinking all the urine from the toilets. Police have been notified and 
should take care of this soon. Below is an advertisement by Fernando Poo Industries. You can buy one bag of poop to eat and 
get another one free! Only at Fernando Poo Stores. Limited time offer. Buy now. Now back to the news. For your traffic report: 
There is a huge crash on Interstate 888, blocking all 6 lanes up 
to the Scamarthur Freeway. People on that route should take a 
detour, although there is no detour. Please stock up on poop from FP Industries so you can eat it if the traffic jam gets really 
bad, because it doesn't look like it's going to clear for a week. So get lost. BWAHAHAHA. Police are investigating this. Your next 
traffic report in 20 minutes. Now, about the monkey in the zoo. It has escaped its exhibit at the zoo and now is drinking pee from
the toilets. It also has been buying poop from Fernando Poo Industries with apparently Monopoly money. Police will include a
report soon on whether the money is Canadian or Monopoly money. 
So, if you see a wild monke nearby, please call the police at 911. No, was it 119? Or 666? Or even 888? Oh, it is 911. You should 
also get your poop to eat soon, as the monke is buying all of the poop and eating it.

		  <pre><!-- part one -->Hello, and welcome to a special edition of our
radio program, PeePee FM. Once again, we can be
reached at 66.6 FM. So tune your radio to there
for some really nice music! First up, wait, what?
<em>(Never Gonna Give You Up plays)</em>
OK, that was a pretty unexpected rick roll. We're
back to normal now. Wait, what's the part below
the rectum?
(anus)
aww man, was that Ms Gousia? Also, the line passing
through the foci of a parabola parallel to the directrix
is called the latus rectum. So where is the latus anus?
That's an intersting question. Because the anus is below
the rectum in the human body, the latus anus should
be below the latus rectum. Let's just assume that the 
latus anus is parallel to the latus rectum and passes
through the vertex. Problem solved.

Wait, oh, another rick roll?
<em>(Alan's parody rick roll)</em>
Oh, and also, I guess that anus wasn't enough.
Here we go again:
<em>(anus, anus, anus.)</em>
OK. That's a lot of anuses. By the way, one of our
listeners got a 3/10 on the Kent mistry test. Here's
an announcement of it:
Har! Har! Har! Did you see the new images
I uploaded? I'm also really bad at, uh, Kentmistry
test. I got a 3/10! And plus, that's because I
wrote "Chemistry test" instead of "Chentmistry 
test"! So yea...
A 3 out of 10 is kinda bad. Considering that Austan
who by the way 15 FAt, got a zero on the same quiz.
He retook and got 7.5. I retook and got 5. GET
L BOZO RAY SHAWN OH'd. And also, one catchphrase
back then: Feces moves out of the rectum and out of
the anus and into your mouth. ADVERTISEMENT: Fernando
Poo Industries is having its poop giveaway again! Come
to our store and get three bags of poop for free! While
supplies last. There's a monke getting so much poop, so
be sure to come soon!
That was the end of the advertisement. Also, doostan
is also fat. Survey: Who is fatter: Doostan or Austan?
Well, that was a trick question. It is pootan. P-O-O-T-A-N.
Get it? P00tan(15)FAtan on the calculator.
Calculator typing is kinda fun.

That's the end of the special report on PeePee
FM. See ya next time!
