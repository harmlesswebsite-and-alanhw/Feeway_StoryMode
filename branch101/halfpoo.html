		<h1>Half Poop Bay</h1>
		<p>You continue on 92 and reach the beach.</p>
		<!-- 
		Editor's comment: When I went to Manresa
		Beach in WATTsonville, California, it was
		cold. No, really. How about we make this
		cold? --weeklyd3
		-->
		<p>Eww. Is that... a clam on the beach?</p>
		<p>No, that's a huge turd.</p>
		<p>Oh no, there's this huge wave...</p>
		<!-- 
		Another editor's note:

		Once, the waves were so large, when I 
		was in front of it, it literally swept
		me onto the beach with a few bloody cuts.
		Would not recommend. --weeklyd3
		-->
		<p>BANG!</p>
		<p>You get knocked onto the turds and are now covered in poop.</p>
		<p>BEEP BEEP! The light's green but you can't tell because of all the poop on your face.</p>
		<p>The palize arrest you for stopping for too long at a green light.</p>
		<p><em>(cynically)</em> HAVE A GOOD DAY.</p>
