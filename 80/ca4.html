		  <pre><!-- part one -->Hello, and welcome to a special edition of our
radio program, PeePee FM. Once again, we can be
reached at 66.6 FM. So tune your radio to there
for some really nice music! First up, wait, what?
<em>(Never Gonna Give You Up plays)</em>
OK, that was a pretty unexpected rick roll. We're
back to normal now. Wait, what's the part below
the rectum?
(anus)
aww man, was that Ms Gousia? Also, the line passing
through the foci of a parabola parallel to the directrix
is called the latus rectum. So where is the latus anus?
That's an intersting question. Because the anus is below
the rectum in the human body, the latus anus should
be below the latus rectum. Let's just assume that the 
latus anus is parallel to the latus rectum and passes
through the vertex. Problem solved.

Wait, oh, another rick roll?
<em>(Alan's parody rick roll)</em>
Oh, and also, I guess that anus wasn't enough.
Here we go again:
<em>(anus, anus, anus.)</em>
OK. That's a lot of anuses. By the way, one of our
listeners got a 3/10 on the Kent mistry test. Here's
an announcement of it:
Har! Har! Har! Did you see the new images
I uploaded? I'm also really bad at, uh, Kentmistry
test. I got a 3/10! And plus, that's because I
wrote "Chemistry test" instead of "Chentmistry 
test"! So yea...
A 3 out of 10 is kinda bad. Considering that Austan
who by the way 15 FAt, got a zero on the same quiz.
He retook and got 7.5. I retook and got 5. GET
L BOZO RAY SHAWN OH'd. And also, one catchphrase
back then: Feces moves out of the rectum and out of
the anus and into your mouth. ADVERTISEMENT: Fernando
Poo Industries is having its poop giveaway again! Come
to our store and get three bags of poop for free! While
supplies last. There's a monke getting so much poop, so
be sure to come soon!
That was the end of the advertisement. Also, doostan
is also fat. Survey: Who is fatter: Doostan or Austan?
Well, that was a trick question. It is pootan. P-O-O-T-A-N.
Get it? P00tan(15)FAtan on the calculator.
Calculator typing is kinda fun.

That's the end of the special report on PeePee
FM. See ya next time!
